This is the README file for Encode::HanExtra, a supplementary pack
of additional Chinese encodings to Encode.pm.

* Installation

Encode::HanExtra uses the standard perl module install process:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install 	# this will run 'enc2xs -C' for you, to update
		# Encode.pm's on-demand loading database

You will need perl 5.7.3 or better, as well as Encode 1.41 or better.

For this module's typical usage and examples, please consult its POD
documentation.
